Titanic Dataset – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to uncover insights about passenger demographics, travel classes, and survival rates. The analysis is beginner-friendly and uses Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data manipulation and visualization.

Objective
The primary goal is to understand factors that influenced passenger survival rates, such as:

Gender

Age

Passenger Class (Pclass)

Embarkation Port

Key Insights
Survival Rates by Gender: Females had a significantly higher survival rate compared to males.

Survival Rates by Class: Passengers in higher classes (1st class) had better chances of survival.

Age Distribution: Most passengers were between 20–40 years old, with children having relatively higher survival rates.

Embarkation Port: Majority of passengers boarded from Southampton, followed by Cherbourg and Queenstown.



Conclusion
The EDA highlights the importance of socio-economic factors and gender in determining survival during the Titanic disaster. These findings can serve as a foundation for predictive modeling in future projects.
